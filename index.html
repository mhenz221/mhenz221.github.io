        <h3>The Sweetest Little Boy</h3>
        <p>Junior was bestowed upon me a little less than five years ago in the fall of 2020, a strange time in New York and in much of the world. </p>
        <p>While it was a hard year for everyone, his coming to me changed my life in ways incalculable and invaluable.</p>
        <p>I might even say he saved me.</p>
