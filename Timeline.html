            <h3 class="h3_article">Before the Resumption of Recording</h3>
                <ul><li>The Cataclysm (est. 300 years Before the Resumption of Recording) An event shrouded in mystery, all that can be said
                        for certain is that a catastrophe came and brought and end to the World-that-Was. The Brothers and Sisters of the College
                        of St. James have a number of theories on the nature of the Cataclysm, including:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A divine act - Believed by many of the faiths, including the Apostolic Church, the Elect of Providence, and the 
                                folk religions, this is the theory that the Creator-God destroyed the World-that-Was for its impiety and heresies.</li>
                            <li>An act of war - Believed by the Federal Church and many of the Order of History of the College of St. James, this is 
                                the theory that the World-that-Was was brought to an end by titanic weapons of war unleashed by the Great Enemy of the 
                                last President-Paragon.</li>
                            <li>Revisionist narrative - Hypothosized by Sister Madonna History of the College of St. James, this is the theory that there
                                was no singular event which ended the World-that-Was, but rather that a number of factors including famine, plague, political
                                turmoil and endless wars brought a gradual collapse to the America-that-Was. This theory denies the reality of the Fey Lands 
                                Beyond the Waters.</li>
                        </ol></li>
                    <li>The Fall of the America-that-Was (est. 280 B.R.R.) The America-that-Was, which once stretched from the coasts of the East to the
                        Golden Empire of Caliphoenecia, collapsed soon after the Cataclysm, despite the desperate attempts of the Generals' Clique to hold together
                        the fragments that remained after the Fire of Columbia and the death of the last Paragon-President in the days of the Cataclysm.</li>
                    <li>The Dark Centuries (280-1 B.R.R.) The nearly three centuries that passed between the Fall of the America-that-Was and the Resumption of
                        Recording. Little written records survive from this time, and even the first generations of the College of St. James lost the recording of 
                        Years. Legends remain of the hardship and privation that swept the lands of This America, and the vast Death that stalked the land.</li>

            <h3 class="h3_article">Since the Resumption of Recording</h3>
                <ul><li>The Resumption of Recording and the New Calendar (The First Year After the Resumption of Recording/1 A.R.R.) Brother Gregory Astronomy of the 
                        College of St. James formulated the New Calendar and travelled away from the Grounds of the College to the first academies at the Scarlet 
                        Library and the Violet Symposium. While he never returned to the Grounds, his count of the years has been adopted by many of the scholastic
                        communities of the coasts of the East and thus by the Princes who request or demand their services. Other calendars kept in the lands of This
                        America include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Apostolic Calendar: Kept by the Apostolic Church, it is maintained by the Apostolic Clergy that this calendar continues the years
                                counted since the death of their Christ, marking this current 848th Year A.R.R. as 3130 Anno Domini (3130 A.D.)</li>
                            <li>The Federal Count: Kept by the Federal Church and most lands of the East before the failure of the Federal Church's Crusade against Philip Makedon, 
                                this counts the four-year cycles kept by the America-that-Was to mark the rulerships of the President-Paragons. While there has been no President-Paragon 
                                since the Cataclysm, the Federal Church maintains that the return will come once all the lands of This America have been brought back into its fold. Marks 
                                this current 848th Year A.R.R. as The Second Turn of the 831st Presidency (2T.831Pr), purportedly counting since the founding of the America-that-Was.</li>
                            <li>The Caliphoenician Lunar Calendar: Established by the First Archon of Caliphoenicia Arnold Black-Egg, this calendar functions based on the 
                                cycles of the moon, fitting the perpetual spring and summer that shines over that land. Purportedly counts the lunar years since the Joining of 
                                Pacifica and the City of Angels into the Empire of Caliphoenicia, marking this current 848th Year A.R.R. as the 607th Year of Caliphoenicia (607 YoC) </li>
                        </ol></li>
                    <li>The Kiowan Invasions (450-497 A.R.R.) A series of organized migrations and raids by the great horse-herds of Kiowa and Kanzas, the Invasions laid waste to many of the
                        princes and cities that had re-established themselves in the lands of the East since the end of the Dark Centuries. A time of great bloodshed and grief, ended only when 
                        the grandson of the First Naća of the Kiowan Herd died mere months into his rule, precipitating the Wars of Succession on the Plains and the withdrawal of most of the 
                        Kiowan armies.</li>
                    <li>The Rise and Fall of the Atlantic Union (600-786 A.R.R.) The predecessor to the Empire-State, the Atlantic Union was a loose confederation of the 
                        cities and princes between Hart's Fort on the Connedycut River and the Brother's City on the Schuylkill. Centered in the Isle of Manahatta and ruled for 
                        most of its duration by the House of Hokul, Dukes and Duchesses of Alban as the High Regents. Always a loose system of alliances at best, the Union collapsed
                        under the military pressures of the Federal Church to the South and the new fanatacism of the Elect to the Northeast, along with renewed economic competition from trade
                        with the Sugar Islands.</li>
                    <li>The Conquests of the Elect (775-800 A.R.R.) The Elect, who preach a radical Christianity from their Holy City of Providence, swept out of Prince Road's Island in the final
                        years of the Atlantic Union and took most of the territory between the Connedycut River and the Duchy of Mann, converting by the sword as they went. </li>

            <h3 class="h3_article">Era of the Empire-State</h3>
                <ul><li>The Rise of Philip Makedon (798 A.R.R.) Once a mere thug in the alleys of Manahatta during the collapse of the Atlantic Union, Philip Makedon rose to become the most feared warlord
                        of the Lands of the East. Through threats, intimidation, and force of arms, he was able to re-forge the lands of the Union into his own Empire-State, which he ruled with an iron fist. 
                        Over his twenty-five years of rule his conquests took him from Hart's Fort on the Connedycut to Holy Columbia on the Pot Mac River, before his death at the age of fifty in 822 A.R.R.,
                        only two years after his victory over the Federal Church and the sack of Columbia, during the Great Council of Reconciliation. It is widely believed that he was poisoned by the merchant 
                        guilds of Columbia.</li>
                    <li>The Crusade of the Federal Church (818 A.R.R.) Twenty years into the reign of Philip Makedon, the Federal Church decided that he had become too much of a threat to their waning hegemony 
                        over the princes and cities of the lands of the East and called a great armed pilgrimage against he who would pretend to assume the mantle of the President-Paragons. Marshalling some fifty
                        thousand of the faithful, the Crusade was routed by half that number of Philip's professional army at Trentondoomand was chased all the way back to the steps of the Congress, cementing the 
                        House of Makedon as the greatest power of the lands of the East.</li>
                    <li>The Crowning of Moses Adams as King-Emperor (823 A.R.R.) The year after the death of his father, Moses Adams was selected by the remaining loyal captains of the armies of the House of Makedon,
                        despite his youth. In the twenty-five years since, he has proven his ability, retaking all of the lands his father had conquered and expanding the borders beyond. His founding of the Cult of Adam
                        and his wide-ranging ambitions make many wonder how far Moses Adams will go before he is laid low by misfortune - or if he will conquer all of This America in his endless ambition.</li>
