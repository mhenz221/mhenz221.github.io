                    <p>The son of Philip of the House Makedon, Moses Adams took the throne of the Empire-State when He 
                        was only barely past His age of majority, after the untimely death - suspected by poisoning -
                        of His father at the Great Council of Reconciliation. Despite His youth, Moses Adams quickly 
                        seized the levers of power in His father's realm, preventing the collapse of the Empire-State
                        into warring factions but two decades after its establishment.<br>In the score and five years
                        since His ascencion to the throne, Moses Adams has wasted little time and effort in accomplishing 
                        His goals. He has purged His father's armies of any who might have been suspected of disloyalty, 
                        eradicated those noble families of the Isle of Manahatta who were implicated in the poisoning of
                        His father, and expanded the borders of the Empire-State from the right bank of the Connedycut River
                        in the North and East, to the Palachian ranges in the West, and far South as the Potmac River, though 
                        He has yet to reclaim the Holy Seat of Columbia from the remnants of the Federal Church.<br>Now, at the
                        height of His power, Moses Adams has turned to questions of divinity and faith, raising up the little-known
                        Cult of Adam, who worship the cataclysm that ended the World that Came Before as the End and the
                        Beginning. He has named Himself the chief and promised Messiah of the Cult, and promises to change the lands
                        of This America as they have not been since that which caused the fall. </p></td>

                <td><h3 class="table_h3">Brother Paul Biology of the College of St. James</h3>
                    <p>A young monk, still a novice of the College of St. James, Paul Biology has yet to prove himself as a worthy 
                    member of the Order as as a practitioner of the Logos. Though he is studious and determined, he is still
                    impatient and quickly grows frustrated with what he sees as foolish behavior and idleness. It is for this reason
                    that his Mentor, Brother-Professor Cato Rhetoric, assigned to Paul the stewardship of precisely one-eighteenth of the
                    College's gardens, that Paul might learn the value of calm and serenity in all studies and in all things. <br> To his,
                    and to Paul's, great surprise, Paul quickly took to the care of flowers, herbs, fruits and vegetables - so much so that, 
                    when an itinerant trader came to the College hawking his wares and telling of a Great Ceremony of Restoration of the World 
                    That Came Before, and when Paul was assigned to travel south to the fabled Isle of Manahatta for the completion of his thesis,
                    Paul could hardly keep himself from weeping, though he had dreamed of such a day since he was but a boy.<br>But Paul had no choice,
                    and would have chosen no different even if he had, as he held the vows of the College above all else - above his love for study,
                    for the gardens, above even the burgeoning love that he and Sister Geat Botany held for each other.<br>So Paul set of into the 
                    unknown world from which he was shielded as a boy, on a journey the end of which he does not know, any more than he knew that it was
                    beginning when he stepped out of the grounds of the College.</p></td><td>

                    <p>Sister Geat Botany was not, like her dear companion Paul, born of the community of the College of St. James. Her mother, who came
                    from the great city of Chikag in the Northwest, was captured by lake raiders and, after years of servitude, escaped her masters
                    during a voyage on the River Lorents. From there she fled through the forests and mountains for weeks, finally collapsing from
                    exhaustion and hunger, as she gave all the food she was able to forage to her young daughter - Geat.<br>
                    She was found by a Sister of the College, who brought her and Geat back to the College's Grounds. Tragically, Geat's mother lingered
                    for only a few months longer, eventually succumbing to the illness she contracted while in the Wilds. And so Geat, who was not yet the
                    age of four, was taken into the ranks of the Brothers and Sisters of the College and was raised according to the ways of the Logos.<br>
                    But Geat has always remembered the cold and hardships of the world beyond the grounds of the College, and remembers her mother, whose 
                    death has always remained with Geat, even if the memories of her mother are few and blurred from the years. And now, she fears that the world
                    beyond the College will again take one that she loves, as Paul ventures away from her, his return at best uncertain.</p></td>

                    <p>A boy of the capital city of the Duchy of Mann, Old Port, Ratrap knew a life of relative peace and ease. Old Port was for a century known as
                    a safe and prosperous place, under the wise and lawful rule of the Dukes and Duchesses of Mann. Ratrap was born to a blacksmith who had grown 
                    a foundry by her own efforts and expertise, and Ratrap had every reason to believe that he would in time take his mother's place.<br>
                    But the whims and obsessions of kings and zealots would finally come to this peaceful city, as the Armies of the Elect marched from their 
                    capitol of Providence to the Colony of Suffolk, and farther north to the Duchy of Mann and Old Port - which after a lengthy siege was burned 
                    to the ground for its Duke's resistance and the so-called heresies of the people.<br>
                    Ratrap stayed in the ashes of his mother's foundry for three days, before he was found by the young Brother Paul biology. With his world shattered,
                    he joined this strange, awkward monk's journey to the Isle of Manahatta, beyond the horizon he never had wished to leave. </p></td>

                    <p>The galley captain Cannato and his first mate Mikala have sailed the coasts and rivers of This America for more than three score years between them,
                    from the Sugar Islands in the tropical latitudes of the Carib Seas to the cold and bitter cliffs of Niw Fenn, beyond which lies only ice and monsters. Both
                    were born in slavery on the island of Rich Port, and both rose against their oppressors in Nat's Great Revolt. While the rebellion failed, Cannato and Mikala
                    were able to flee on a merchant's ship sailing to Manahatta, paying their way as deckhands.<br>
                    They would never truly leave the waters after this. Ten years later they were able to purchase their own sloop, and five years later the galley that they still 
                    sail. And they have not given up their dream of freedom, not just for themselves but for all. In the face of greatest danger to their lives, they secretly ferry 
                    escaped slaves and prisoners from those lands that so violate the natural laws of This America, as written in the Codes of the Federal Church - freeing more than
                    a thousand souls from the labor-gangs of the Empire-State, the serfdom of the Papal State of Rome-in-Orleans, and slaves from the Sugar Islands, including their
                    own relatives.<br>
                    As the King-Governor of the Empire-State expands his wars and his borders, their work has grown only more dangerous - yet they still turn away none in need. In 
                    Burling-town of the Green Mountains, Mikala met a wayward monk with a child in tow, seeking travel down the Connedycut river - and despite Cannato's mistrust of any
                    clad in robes, agreed to give them passage, refusing even the paltry few coins that the monk, Brother Paul Biology, tried to offer. But there are rumors of a blockade
                    at the mouth of the Connedycut, and wolfish skiffs patrolling the banks of the river. Though Mikala ignores such rumors, Cannato has started to wonder how much longer
                    the waters will remain, as they always have been, free.</p></td>
