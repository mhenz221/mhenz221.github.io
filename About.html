            <p>This website is about a book that Matthew Henzy (pictured) wrote for his creative writing MFA. He thinks 
                it's fun though he wrote it a few years ago and would definitely do some major revision on the manuscript 
                if he wasn't focusing on other things right now. He'll get to it. also if you want to read the book you
                should ask him, he has some printed copies that he is happy to lend.</p>
